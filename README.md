# CallSync
is an open-source scheduling platform designed as an alternative to Calendly and Cal. It provides a robust infrastructure for managing bookings and appointments based on user-defined availability. By integrating with Google Calendar, Schedulo streamlines the scheduling processâ€”automating event creation and sending timely meeting reminders.

Users can easily sync their Google Calendar, configure their availability, and generate a public booking page for seamless appointment management. This project features a fully developed backend and a user-friendly interface, ensuring an efficient and intuitive scheduling experience.

## Tech stack used to build Schedulo
- Typescript
- React
- Node
- Express
- Mongo DB
- Passport (for google-oauth)
- Redux Toolkit

CallSync is an application similar to cal.com which includes:
- Backend Development: Created from scratch using Node.js and
Express, with MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the ORM.
- State Management: Managed state using Redux Toolkit and handled
data querying/manipulation on the frontend.
- Google Calendar Integration: Implemented user authentication and
calendar integration using the Passport library.
